# Course Scheduler for the Hispanic Studies Department

Collaborated with two peers to create a databases solution to a course scheduling problem for the University of Puget Sound Hispanic Studies Department. 

Given a set of courses (see CourseTemplate.xlsx) and professor preferences (see ProfessorTemplate.xlsx), we populate a database using a relatonal model implemented in SQLite, and generate several possible schedules based on different ranking systems. We built a user interface for simple user interaction.

Our database schema:
